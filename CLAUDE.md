# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered content moderation repository focused on profanity detection and filtering. The project combines AI models with traditional profanity libraries for content moderation.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal files:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- This is a new project without established source code structure yet

## Development Notes

Since this is a newly initialized repository with only a README file, the specific technology stack, build processes, and architecture are not yet established. Future development will need to determine:
- Programming language and framework choice
- Build and dependency management system
- Testing framework and processes
- Project structure and organization

The project appears to be focused on content moderation combining AI and profanity library approaches, suggesting it will likely involve:
- Natural language processing components
- Profanity detection libraries
- AI model integration
- Content filtering mechanisms
